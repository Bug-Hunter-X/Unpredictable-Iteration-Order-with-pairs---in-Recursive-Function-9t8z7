This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Lua related to the order of iteration in `pairs()` when used within a recursive function. The `bug.lua` file contains code that exhibits this behavior.  The `bugSolution.lua` file provides a possible solution using a different iteration method that ensures consistent iteration order.  The issue stems from the fact that `pairs()` does not guarantee a specific iteration order, and this order can vary between Lua implementations and even between different runs of the same code.
